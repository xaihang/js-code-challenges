# JavaScript Code Challenges + Jest Testing 
This repository contains a collection of random JavaScript code challenges with Jest test units. The code challenges cover various topics in JavaScript programming, such as arithmetic operations, string manipulation, array manipulation, and more. Each code challenge has a corresponding Jest test unit, allowing developers to test their solutions and check if they meet the desired functionality. This repository is intended for developers who want to practice their JavaScript programming skills and learn how to write test units using Jest.

1. Test your solution:
    * by specific code challenge file, run `npm test <filename.test.js>` in the terminal.
    * by the whole /unsolved file, `cd` into /unsolved file then run `npm test` in the terminal   
1. Check the output of the test to see if your solution meets the desired functionality.
1. Repeat the process for other code challenges to improve your JavaScript programming skills and Jest test unit knowledge.
