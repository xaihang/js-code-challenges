//DIRECTION:
// You need to create a function that accepts a string as an argument 
// and determines whether or not the string is a palindrome.
// A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence 
// of characters that reads the same forward and backward.
// To solve this challenge, you will need to compare the 
// characters in the string from both ends (front and back) and determine if they are the same.
// You should return true if the string is a palindrome and false if it is not.


const isPalindrome = function(str) {
 
};


// Please do not modify the code below, make changes only to the code above.
module.exports = isPalindrome;
