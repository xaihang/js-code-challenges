//DIRECTION:
// Write a code that will loop through an array of numbers. 
// At each iteration, you need to check if the current number is divisible by 3, 5, or both. 
// If it's divisible by 3, print "Fizz". 
// If it's divisible by 5, print "Buzz". 
// If it's divisible by both 3 and 5, print "Fizz Buzz". 
// Finally, if the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, print the number itself.


const fizzBuzz = function(arr) {
  
};

// Please do not modify the code below, make changes only to the code above.
module.exports = fizzBuzz;
